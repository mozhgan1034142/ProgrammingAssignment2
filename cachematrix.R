# makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
# It provides methods to set and get the value of the matrix, as well as to set 
# and get the cached inverse. This allows for efficient retrieval of the inverse 
# without recalculating it if the matrix has not changed.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


# cacheSolve computes the inverse of a special "matrix" object created by makeCacheMatrix.
# It first checks if the inverse has already been calculated and cached. 
# If the cached inverse is available, it retrieves it to avoid redundant computation.
# If not, it calculates the inverse using the solve function, caches the result, 
# and then returns the computed inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
